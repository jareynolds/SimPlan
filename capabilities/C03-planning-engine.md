# C03 Planning Engine
Reference: Capability C03
Description: Generates execution plan: topological order, critical path, resource allocation, rollback strategy, preliminary cost estimation.
Linked Enablers: E03 Graph & Planning Algorithms; E04 Execution Framework; E08 Cost Engine Data Sources; E16 Optimization Advisory.
Rationale: Optimized plan reduces time/cost and ensures dependency correctness for provisioning (C04).
Dependencies: Parsed model (C02), constraints from spec (C01).
